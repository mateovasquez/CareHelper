# Care Helper
This is a landing page for the Care Helper app. This project was born in a accessibility hackathon, Hack The Gap, organised by [Factoria F5](http://factoriaf5.org/).
## Description
We all have elderly people around our environment (parents, grandparents, relatives or not other persons) and we can find ourselves with the need to take care of them or to go to a person of trust to do it but doesn't have the minimum expirience to do it well.
Without falling into self-medication we are creating this simple but powerful platform that offers videos in what we consider to be the 4 most important topics of daily care, where anyone could be able to acces to a series of informative videos of how to act in different common situations.
In addition, we offer tips when the app starts where ideas are given to the user about what they may be doing wrong.
